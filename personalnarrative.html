As a Communications and Digital Media student at SJU, 
both my coursework and my extra-curricular activities have driven me to seek out 
a career working in the nonprofit sector. Rooted in ethics, my courses have
allowed me to explore the role of the digital world in our current society, as well 
as understand how the Internet, social media, and other Web 2.0 literacies can 
contribute to the social good of society. I hope to use these insights and skills
in a philanthropic way, in order to bring about positive social change.

In the winter of 2013, I was able to travel to the Mexican border for an 
intensive immersion experience. While I was there, I came into contact with 
some nonprofit organizations that are working on substantitive, real life issues. 
However, I also saw a need; a need for digital skills that will allow such 
organizations to achieve these goals on a larger scale. 
I hope to find a career that will allow me to bring these skills to others.

One course in particular, Social Media and Community Engagement, has impacted me particularly. 
The course allows for Communications students to work directly with nonprofit organizations 
in the Philadelphia area. Students 
partner with such organizations and help them develop their social media 
campaigns, web design, or multimedia production. 
This hands on experience has given me great insight into the nonprofit world,
and because of this experience, I was able to intern with The Clery Center, 
a nonprofit that works to passionately assist the victims of violence on college campuses. 
I developed a social media campaign for National Campus Safety Awareness Month, and was able
to use my knowledge from my coursework and hands on experience to execute this task.
